% Create an example adjacency matrix made up of ones and zeros.

% Call CIRCULARGRAPH with only the adjacency matrix as an argument.

% Click on a node to make the connections that emanate from it more visible
% or less visible. Click on the 'Show All' button to make all nodes and
% their connections visible. Click on the 'Hide All' button to make all
% nodes and their connections less visible.

%% 2. Supply custom properties
% Create an example adjacency matrix made up of various values and supply
% custom properties.
